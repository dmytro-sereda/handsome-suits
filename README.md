# Handsome Suits

E-commerce website selling suits. This product can mimic some of React features using only vanilla javascript. I used MVC (Model View Controller) architecture and OOP (Object Oriented Programming) paradigm in order to create this application. Since state management was not a complex task in this case, simple JavaScript object was used for this objective.

## Available Scripts

`npm run watch:sass` - script that watches SASS code changes and recompiles the code

`npm run devserver` - script that runs live-server in chrome

`npm start` - uses parcel to bundle

`npm run compile:sass` - compiles sass code into css file

`npm run prefix:css` - prefixes css code with modern browsers prefixes

`npm run compress:css` - compresses css code

`npm run build:css` - runs all scripts above one after another and produces compressed css file in the end

`npm run build` - parcel builds final project into the dist folder

_Please note: filters and search are unavailable, since the objective was to dynamically generate cart and product page._
