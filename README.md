# Handsome Suits

Managed a team to build e-commerce website selling suits from scratch, which can mimic some fo React features, but using only vanilla javascript. MVC (Model View Controller) architecture and OOP (Object Oriented Programming) paradigm were used in order to create this application. Since state management was not a complex task in this case, simple JavaScript object was used for this objective. Please note: filters and search are unavailable, since the objective was to dynamically generate cart and product page.
